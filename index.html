        <h2>I suffer from general anxiety and depression.</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>More anxiety than depression, but they often go hand in hand and share many symptoms.</li>
          <li>Sometimes I get full blown panic attacks.</li>
          <li>This all <em>got real</em> for me six or seven years ago.</li>

        <h2>What is General Anxiety?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>In a nutshell, it’s a chemical imbalance in the brain.</li>
          <li>Our bodies naturally release adrenaline when we’re in fight or flight situations—such as running from a bear.</li>
          <li>When our bodies release adrenaline in this way in normal every day life this causes one to feel anxiety.</li>
          <li>It becomes a bigger problem when you have triggers that cause anxiety. For me, traveling is one of my biggest triggers.</li>

        <h2>What does Anxiety or a Panic Attack feel like?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Aside from the physical effects, it feels like an impending sense of doom looming over me. If that sounds corny let me assure you—it isn’t.</li>
          <li>Panic Attacks are the absolute worse. A lot of people end up going to the ER when experiencing their first one.</li>
          <li>For those that might say “push past it” (and I used to be one of those) it’s not that simple. Even if you can rationalize it, you can't just stop the effects.</li>

        <h2>I decided to get help.</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Two years ago I backed out of Summit because I was “sick” and just couldn’t handle the anxiety anymore.</li>
          <li>I was ashamed to admit that I needed help. I called a therapist that week. Looking back, I should have done this sooner as it had been affecting my family for several years.</li>
          <li>Visiting a therapist and meditation has helped a lot.</li>
          <li>I still experience anxiety and panic attacks (less frequently) and it still sucks.</li>

        <h2>So where am I now?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I don’t know if I’ll suffer from anxiety or need meds for the rest of my life, but if I do I’ve more or less made peace with that.</li>
          <li>While it’s a struggle and something I think about often it doesn’t define who I am.</li>

        <h2>Way to be a bummer, Dan…</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>There’s a lot of people with mental heath challenges and are embarrassed to admit it or do something about it.</li>
          <li>There’s a stigma attached to mental health for various reasons. Some people simply don’t understand mental health challenges.</li>
          <li>It’s not much different then seeking medical attention for a broken bone or taking Tylenol when you have a headache.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Thank you Zach Holman and Andrea, for giving me the inspiration to open up.</li>
          <li>I just wanted to share a little bit of my experience with anxiety to raise a little more awareness of mental health issues.</li>
          <li>If you experience anxiety or mental health issues and don’t know who to talk to—talk to me.</li>
